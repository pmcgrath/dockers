Ports
	EXPOSE :80						Nginx where we can see the dashboards - will want to access this outside the container
	EXPOSE :2003					Don't need this outside the container as we always right through statsd and never directly to graphite - so remove this
	EXPOSE :2004					? Dumping this, don't know what this is
	EXPOSE :7002					? Dumping this, don't know what this is
	EXPOSE :8125/udp				Need this as this is where statsd listens
	EXPOSE :8126					Might get rid of this as it does expose delcounters method etc.


Pending
	Do we need aggregator app ?
	Do we need aggregator app config with retention details ?
	Do we need a relay ?
	What is pickle
		Batch writes ?

	Why does echo stats | nc localhost 8126 sometimes fail, always works if not on host
	ufw rules

	node installation
		statsd is from head
			Can we use wgte rather than git ?

	Dockerfile 
		Complete exposes
		Data volumes
		Cmd
		Remove vim

	Nginix - use include file as normal rather than inlined file

carbon.conf file
[relay]
and
[aggregator]

Dont believe we need these - In simple installations, there is typically only one daemon, carbon-cache.py
relay 
	carbon-relay.py serves two distinct purposes: replication and sharding.
aggregator
	carbon-aggregator.py can be run in front of carbon-cache.py to buffer metrics over time before reporting them into whisper.

storage-aggregation.conf file
