Ports
	EXPOSE :80						Nginx where we can see the dashboards - will want to access this outside the container
	EXPOSE :2003					Don't need this outside the container as we always right through statsd and never directly to graphite - so remove this
	EXPOSE :2004					? Dumping this, don't know what this is
	EXPOSE :7002					? Dumping this, don't know what this is
	EXPOSE :8125/udp				Need this as this is where statsd listens
	EXPOSE :8126					Might get rid of this as it does expose delcounters method etc.
